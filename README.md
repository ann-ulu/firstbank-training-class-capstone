# Training Capstone

There are two criteria for this project:

1. You are able to utilize prompt engineering in this codebase so that the Azure OpenAI GPT model is able to generate better image prompts for DALL-E
2. You are able to improve the User Experience (UX) of the Dash app so that a user can see:\
    i. The prompt generated by the GPT model (i.e. meta prompt)\
    ii. A progress loader from Dash to show the progress of the process.\
    iii. Better UI elements for the input box and the submit button

You can unleash your creativity to the maximum and even choose to instruct Dall-E to generate more than one image through the API call in the code. This does not count towards your score. Only the first two criteria count towards your score.

## Setting up this project 


To set up this project, you need to fork the repo to your Github account, then clone it to your local machine. You can also use Github Codespace or Gitpod.


### Forking the project
Forking means copying the repo to your account so that you have your own copy. You can find the fork button on the project's Github Homepage as shown in the image below:

After clicking on the fork button, it'll show a page where you complete the fork. Complete the fork by clicking on the "Create fork" button.

### Cloning to your local machine

After forking the repo, you need to clone your forked version to your local machine. Change the <YOUR_USERNAME> placeholder in the command below to your Github username, then run the command to complete the clone:

```
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/firstbank-training-class-capstone.git capstone-project
```

The command above will clone the Github repo to a folder, capstone-project, on your local machine. You can open it on VSCode using the command below:

```
code capstone-project
```

### Cloning to a Github Codespace

You can also clone the repo to a Github codespace which gives you the leverage to use the project without stressing on dependencies and Python versions. Use the codespace tab that shows when you click on the "Clone" button.

Ensure you have already forked the repo before attempting to use Codespaces. If the Codespaces doesn't show, check that you are signed in to Github.

## Running this project

After cloning the repo do the following:

1. Create a .env file from the .env.example file. You can choose to duplicate the .env.example file and then rename it to .env or run the following command:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Install the dependencies using the command below:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set the environment variables from the Azure OpenAI resource and Azure OpenAI studio

4. Run the app.py file using the command below:

```
python app.py
```


## Note

1. The main.py file does not have anything to do with the app. It's just a file you can use to quickly check that your API keys are working
2. You should create a .env file from your .env.example file to ensure that the environment variables are obtained
3. If you are on your local machine, you should create a new virtual environment for your project. But if you are on Codespaces, you don't have to.
